# Algorithms

Hello! This repository contains algorithms I've accumulated in college. Some from CS courses at JHU, some from online courses, and some from reading cool papers or textbooks. My goal is to build out a toolbox to rapidly test algorithms on a new problem I encounter, and gain an intuition for how these algorithms perform on real world data. 

Enjoy :)
