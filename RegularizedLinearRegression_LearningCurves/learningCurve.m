%LEARNINGCURVE Generates the train and cross validation set errors needed 
%to plot a learning curve
%       LEARNINGCURVE(X, y, Xval, yval, lambda) returns the train and
%       cross validation set errors for a learning curve. In particular, 
%       it returns two vectors of the same length - error_train and 
%       error_val. Then, error_train(i) contains the training error for
%       i examples (and similarly for error_val(i)).
%
%   Xval and Yval are cross validation sets
%

m = size(X, 1);

error_train = zeros(m, 1);
error_val   = zeros(m, 1);

% ====================== YOUR CODE HERE ======================
% Instructions: Fill in this function to return training errors in 
%               error_train and the cross validation errors in error_val. 
%               i.e., error_train(i) and 
%               error_val(i) should give you the errors
%               obtained after training on i examples.
%
% Note: You should evaluate the training error on the first i training
%       examples (i.e., X(1:i, :) and y(1:i)).
%
%       For the cross-validation error, you should instead evaluate on
%       the _entire_ cross validation set (Xval and yval).
%
% Note: If you are using your cost function (linearRegCostFunction)
%       to compute the training and cross validation error, you should 
%       call the function with the lambda argument set to 0. 
%       Do note that you will still need to use lambda when running
%       the training to obtain the theta parameters.



for i = 1:m
    theta = trainLinearReg(X(1:i, :), y(1:i), lambda);
    error_train(i) = linearRegCostFunction(X(1:i, :), y(1:i), theta, 0); %set lambda to zero
    error_val(i) = linearRegCostFunction(Xval, yval, theta, 0); %use the theta
    %computed from training set to compute error on validation set
